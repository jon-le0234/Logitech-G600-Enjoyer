# Buy
Despite its discontinuation, there isn't exactly a competitor that fills its place.

The G600 isn't coming back, so buy a few and store them in a safe place. Follow the 3-2-1 rule of backups: 3 copies, 2 different media (doesn't apply, so maybe 2 colours?), 1 off-site. Search used listings on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=g600+g600t), [Craigslist](https://craigslist.org), [Kijiji](https://www.kijiji.ca), etc. 

Look for Logicool G600t ([Amazon.co.jp](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B01D45U6LA)) and G600r ([Amazon.co.jp](https://www.amazon.co.jp/ロジクール-G600r-LOGICOOL-MMOゲーミングマウス/dp/B00CDCL21O?th=1)) sold in Japan.

# Repairs and Upgrades
If you have one already but it's not functioning, repair it. Resoldering new switches is the main fix, but soldering isn't always required.

## Logitech Gaming Software
The original software that worked with the G600 when it was released. Still works on Windows 11. Handy to have as a daily driver or backup when G HUB doesn't work.

Missing some of the newer macro functions of G HUB.

On Windows 11, I sometimes get a bug where the DPI won't set correctly after a reboot until I start LGS and open the DPI page.

## Logitech G Hub
[Download for Windows and macOS](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ca/software/ghub)

Pros:
- Newer software with wider support for devices
- Game profiles
- More advanced macros than LGS
- [Lua scripting](https://luascripts.com/logitech-lua-scripting)

Cons:
- Rather bloated piece of software if you only want some simple macro buttons.
- Doesn't always work properly on Windows.
- Doesn't seem to work on M-series Macs with the G600.
- Doesn't support Linux.

Strikes an important naming convention:

    View 1 -> Top of the mouse

    View 2 -> Keypad on the side

### Lua scripting
[Lua Cheatsheet for Logitech G Hub](https://github.com/jehillert/logitech-ghub-lua-cheatsheet) by jehillert

### Settings
Back up your programmed settings in G HUB.

Windows:

    C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\LGHUB\settings.db


macOS:

    /Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Application Support/lghub/settings.db

### Troubleshooting
Update drivers from Device Manager [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/w9tpji/g600_mouse_stuck_on_loading_resources/iq9gk14/?context=10000)

As per Logitech Support, uninstall and reinstall G HUB [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/wpr5x6/g_hub_doesnt_recognize_g600_anymore/iki7jvq/?context=10000)
1. Uninstall G HUB
2. Make sure none of the G HUB components are running in the Task Manager
3. Delete the following directories:
    * `C:\Program Files\LGHUB`
    * `C:\ProgramData\LGHUB`
    * `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\LGHUB`
    * `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\LGHUB`
4. Delete registry key
    * `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{521c89be-637f-4274-a840-baaf7460c2b2}`
5. Reboot the PC
6. Re-install G HUB.
7. If issue persists, install Logitech Gaming Software.

Apps like [Bulk Crap Uninstaller](https://www.bcuninstaller.com) and [PearCleaner](https://itsalin.com/appInfo/?id=pearcleaner) make the uninstallation process a bit easier.

## Logitech Onboard Memory Manager
[Download](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-in/articles/360059641133-Onboard-Memory-Manager)

G HUB without the macros.

I couldn't get it to work on my Windows 11 PC. *shrug*

## g600prog by tulth
Cross-platform script to program the G600 using Python
https://github.com/tulth/g600prog

Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install prerequisites: 

```
pip install pyusb libusb
```
#### macOS
Per [installation instructions](https://github.com/houmain/keymapper?tab=readme-ov-file#macos), need Karabiner Elements' virtual device driver. I couldn't get the standalone driver to work, so I just installed the full Karabiner Elements.

On macOS, use the following command to download the current config from the mouse to your Mac:
```
sudo python3 g600prog.py MOUSE current_mouse_cfg.json
```

To upload a new config from your Mac to the mouse, use:
```
sudo python3 g600prog.py default_fnumpad.json MOUSE
```
Here's what the output will look like.
```
% sudo python3 g600prog.py default_fnumpad.json MOUSE
Reading mouse config from file >default_fnumpad.json< ...
... done reading mouse config from file
Writing the mouse config to the mouse...
...done writing read mouse config to the mouse
```

### Windows
Not recommended, in my experience, especially since I wanted to use keymapper. Logitech Gaming Software and G HUB were far simpler.

PyUSB requires libusb, but . To replace the mouse driver with libusb on Windows, use Zadig.
1. Create a System Restore point.
2. Download Zadig: https://zadig.akeo.ie
    1. The latest version is 2.9 as of this writing.
3. Run `zadig-2.9.exe`.
4. In the toolbar, navigate to `Options > List All Devices`.
5. In the dropdown menu, select `Gaming Mouse G600 Interface 1`.
    1. If I understand correctly, `Interface 0` drives the mouse cursor, whereas `Interface 1` is the driver for the buttons/keyboard.
6. Under Driver, select `libusb-win32 (v1.4.0.0)`.
7. Click the `Replace Driver` button.

I installed `WinUSB` by accident, and it was a tricky bugger to remove. There are a few apps that can help with the process.

1. Delete driver.
   1. Device Manager
      1. Show hidden/disconnected deviceps [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/device-manager-does-not-display-devices-that-are-not-connected-e7148232-40ae-bb07-0077-88f2e859b53f)
   2. [Driver Store Explorer](https://github.com/lostindark/DriverStoreExplorer)
      1. Create a System Restore point.
      2. Run as admin.
      3. Delete the `g600.inf` driver by `libuwb`.
2. Delete records of the G600 in the Registry.
   1. Back up registry.
   2. Create System Restore point.
   3. This is tricky to do manually since even with Administrator privileges, you can't delete certain registry keys. Instead, you need to use the System account. Fortunately there are apps that can automate this operation.
   4. [Device Cleanup Tool](https://www.uwe-sieber.de/misc_tools_e.html) by Uwe Sieber
      1. Run as administrator.
      2. Unplug G600.
      3. Click F5 to refresh devices.
      4. Select all of the G600 devices that appear now that it is disconnected from the system.
   5. [USBDeview](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html) by NirSoft
   6. [USBOblivion](https://github.com/raspopov/USBOblivion) by cherubicsoft
   7. [Ghostbuster](https://bitbucket.org/wvd-vegt/ghostbuster/src/master/) by Wim van der Vegt

Download or clone the `g600prog` repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/tulth/g600prog
cd g600prog
```
For Windows, download the `g600prog.py` file provided in this repo under profiles/g600prog. Added a small patch to check if platform is Windows before running a Linux driver command.


On Windows, use the following command to download the current config from the mouse to your Windows PC:
```
python g600prog.py MOUSE current_cfg.json
```

To upload a new config from your Windows PC to the mouse, use:
```
python g600prog.py new_mouse_cfg.json MOUSE
```

# Software Programming
Though the hardware programming enables an expansion of functions that can be called from the mouse, the software programming can expand that number even more. This customizability and density sits at the core of the G600's power and beauty.

Since the keypad is recognized as a keyboard under the Human Interface Device (HID) class within the OS, we can use any keyboard remapping software.

## keymapper
[keymapper](https://github.com/houmain/keymapper) is a powerful cross platform, context-aware keyboard remapper with a text-based configuration system. 

Most importantly, it can automatically switch behaviours based on attributes like the OS, the window title, device name/ID, etc. For example, G HUB can target a web browser application, but if I set it to a browser, it can't change the G600's keys based on the website. Using keymapper, I can use the [title] tag so that my G600 has unique key combinations for that website.

### Windows
Per [installation instructions](https://github.com/houmain/keymapper?tab=readme-ov-file#virtual-device-driver), some users may need to set up [Interception](https://github.com/oblitum/Interception) in order to filter by device.

I use it so I can assign macros to the Numpad keys hardware-programmed onto my G600 but still use the Numpad on my keyboard as usual.
1. Clone or download the Interception repository.
2. Run Command Prompt/Terminal as Administrator.
   1. Type Win + X, then click A.
3. Navigate to `Interception\command line installer`.
4. Run the following command:
   1. `.\install-interception.exe /install`
5. Reboot.
6. Navigate to `Interception\library` and select the appropriate directory for your CPU architecture.
7. Copy `interception.dll` to the same folder as your `keymapperd` executables, e.g., `C:\Program Files\keymapper`.

# Sharing Profiles
If the G600 is programmed with a hardware configuration that has better default keycodes, then software configurations can be more easily shared. G HUB already does this with updates to the hardware profiles for different games, but they stopped short of productivity apps and additional software profiles.

Each workflow maps a little differently based on the user's brain because of things like training, muscle memory, games/applications, etc. But surely there are enough similarities out there that all G600 and MMO mouse users can benefit.

The main limitation of this approach is that the number of "unused" keycodes is limited and dependent on your specific workflows. Also, if you use multiple modes, then there aren't enough unused keycodes that can be used across all 173 possible keys.

Logitech updates G HUB with profiles for the latest games, but that doesn't reach to other applications or web apps. There could and should be some way for the G600 community to share their configs easily, either through programming the hardware keys or with a generic set of hardware keys and a common software layer that handles the application switching.

## Proposed Sharing Profile: F13-F24, NumPad, g600prog, keymapper
The "What":
1. F13 through F24 for View 2
2. Numpad for G-Shift of View 2 and some of View 1.
   1. This is already the default

The "How":
1. Program the keypad with proposed default config ([default_fnumpad.json](default_fnumpad.json)) using g600prog
2. G Hub and LGS can be used to program mice this way as well.
   1. A `settings.db` file could be shared.
3. Customize profile with keymapper.
   1. For those that use Numpad on keyboards, keymapper can restrict remapping to just the G600 using `[device="Gaming Mouse G600"]`.
4. Share!
   1. How to build a community/social network around a single electronic device? I don't know, but I'm open to ideas.
