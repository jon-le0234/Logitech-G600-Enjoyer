# Logitech G600 Enjoyer
A collection of resources for fans of the tragically discontinued Logitech G600 MMO gaming mouse.

# Buy
Despite its discontinuation, there isn't exactly a competitor that fills its place.

The G600 isn't coming back, so buy a few and store them in a safe place. Follow the 3-2-1 rule of backups: 3 copies, 2 different media (doesn't apply, so maybe 2 colours?), 1 off-site. Search used listings on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=g600+g600t), [Craigslist](https://craigslist.org), [Kijiji](https://www.kijiji.ca), etc. 

Look for Logicool G600t ([Amazon.co.jp](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B01D45U6LA)) and G600r ([Amazon.co.jp](https://www.amazon.co.jp/ロジクール-G600r-LOGICOOL-MMOゲーミングマウス/dp/B00CDCL21O?th=1)) sold in Japan.

# Repairs and Upgrades
If you have one already but it's not functioning, repair it. Resoldering new switches is the main fix, but soldering isn't always required.

## Skate pads
To open up the mouse, there's a chance you'll damage the original skate pads, so order some replacements before you get started.

# Programming Keys
## Hardware Programming
### Logitech G Hub
[Download for Windows and macOS](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ca/software/ghub)

Newer, fancier software with wider support for newer devices. Rather bloated piece of software for what it does. Doesn't always work properly, like on M-series Mac. Doesn't support Linux.

Strikes an important naming convention:

    View 1 -> Top of the mouse

    View 2 -> Keypad on the side

#### Settings
Back up your programmed settings in G HUB.

Windows:

    C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\LGHUB\settings.db


macOS:

    /Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Application Support/lghub/settings.db

#### Troubleshooting
Update drivers from Device Manager [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/w9tpji/g600_mouse_stuck_on_loading_resources/iq9gk14/?context=10000)

Reinstall G Hub [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/wpr5x6/g_hub_doesnt_recognize_g600_anymore/iki7jvq/?context=10000)
1. Uninstall G HUB
1. Make sure none of the G HUB components are running in the Task Manager
1. Delete the following directories:
    * `C:\Program Files\LGHUB`
    * `C:\ProgramData\LGHUB`
    * `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\LGHUB`
    * `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\LGHUB`
1. Delete registry key
    * `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{521c89be-637f-4274-a840-baaf7460c2b2}`
1. Reboot the PC
1. Re-install G HUB.
1. If issue persists, install Logitech Gaming Software.

### Logitech Gaming Software

The original software that worked with the G600 when it was released. Works on Windows 11. Handy to have as a backup or even a main software.

G HUB without the macros.

### g600prog

Cross-platform scrip to program the G600 using Python: https://github.com/tulth/g600prog

Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install prerequisite: 

```
pip install pyusb
```

Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/tulth/g600prog
cd g600prog
```

On macOS, use the following command to download the current config from the mouse to your Mac:
```
sudo python3 g600prog.py MOUSE current_mouse_cfg.json
```

After you've created a new config using the provided template, to upload a new config from your Mac to the mouse, use:
```
sudo python3 g600prog.py new_mouse_cfg.json MOUSE
```
Here's what the output will look like.
```
% sudo python3 g600prog.py default_fnumpad.json MOUSE
Reading mouse config from file >default_fnumpad.json< ...
... done reading mouse config from file
Writing the mouse config to the mouse...
...done writing read mouse config to the mouse
```
## Software Programming
Since the keypad is recognized as a keyboard under the Human Interface Device (HID) class within the OS, we can use any keyboard remapping software.

The one I like most so far is [keymapper](https://github.com/houmain/keymapper).

### keymapper
It's a powerful cross platform, context-aware keyboard remapper with a text-based configuration system. 

Most importantly, it can automatically switch behaviours based on attributes like the OS, the window title, device name/ID, etc. Though the hardware programming enables an expansion of functions that can be called from the mouse, the software programming can expand that number even more. This customizability and density sits at the core of the G600's power and beauty. Such a tragedy that it was discontinued.

## Sharing Configurations
If the G600 is programmed with a hardware configuration that has better default keycodes, then software configurations can be more easily shared. G HUB already does this with updates to the hardware profiles for different games, but they stopped short of productivity apps and additional software profiles.

Each workflow maps a little differently based on the user's brain because of things like training, muscle memory, games/applications, etc. But surely there are enough similarities out there that all G600 and MMO mouse users can benefit.

The main limitation of this approach is that the number of "unused" keycodes is limited and dependent on your specific workflows. Also, if you use multiple modes, then there aren't enough unused keycodes that can be used across all 173 possible keys.

## Proposed Sharing Profile: F13-F24, NumPad, g600prog, keymapper
If people programmed their hardware buttons to the following keycodes, then keymapper configs could be shared more easily.

1. Program the keypad with proposed default config ([default_fnumpad.json](default_fnumpad.json)) using g600prog
    1. [F13 through F24](https://old.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/11a49es/g600_mouse_button_beyond_4_and_5/) for View 2
    1. Numpad for some of View 1 and G-Shift for View 2.
    1. G Hub and LGS can be used to program mice this way as well, but it's more work.
1. Customize profile with keymapper
    1. For those that use Numpad on keyboards, keymapper can restrict remapping to just the G600 using `[device="Gaming Mouse G600"]`.

### View 1
1. #G1 = LeftMouse
1. #G2 = RightMouse
1. #G3 = MiddleMouse
1. G4 = NumpadMultiply
1. G5 = NumpadDivide
1. #G6 = GShift
1. G7 = NumpadAdd
1. G8 = NumpadSubtract

### G-Shift + View 1
I honestly don't find it comfortable using G-Shift with any of the View 1 keys, so I don't have anything to list here.

1. #SG1 = 
1. #SG2 = 
1. #SG3 = 
1. #SG4 = 
1. #SG5 = 
1. #SG6 = # You can't use G-Shift with itself, silly
1. #SG7 = 
1. #SG8 = 

### View 2
1. G9 = F13
1. G10 = F14
1. G11 = F15
1. G12 = F16
1. G13 = F17
1. G14 = F18
1. G15 = F19
1. G16 = F20
1. G17 = F21
1. G18 = F22
1. G19 = F23
1. G20 = F24

### G-Shift + View 2
1. SG9 = Numpad7
1. SG10 = Numpad8
1. SG11 = Numpad9
1. SG12 = Numpad4
1. SG13 = Numpad5
1. SG14 = Numpad6
1. SG15 = Numpad1
1. SG16 = Numpad2
1. SG17 = Numpad3
1. SG18 = Numpad0
1. SG19 = NumpadDecimal
1. SG20 = NumpadEnter
